# Harry Potter Adventure Game

#### Description

This project is my first try at producing a basic GUI. As a life long
Harry Potter fan I decided that I would attempt to make a basic game based
on the Wizarding World as imagined by JK Rowling. I decided to try to keep
the graphics simple to just get my feet wet with managing both the front end,
graphics side of things as well as the backend development.

In the game you are Harry Potter and you must traverse the castle of Hogwarts
and the accompanying grounds in order to locate and destroy all of Lord Voldemort's horcruxes before finally battling Lord Voldemort.
